Technical documents to help explain REXXXREF code.
   TECH01 - how "fast" variable lookup's work
            ... critical to understanding code in REXXXREF.

   TECH02 - how some of the "data structures" are related in REXXXREF
            - data structures for variables/labels
            - data structures for stem variabls
            - data structures for special variables
            - data structures for special stem variables
            - data structures for rexx statement we handle

   TECH03 - Logic + "data structures" in pass 1 (looking at user rexx code)

   TECH04 - Logic + "data structures" in c9900OutputResults (creating xref 1 + 2)

   TECH05 - Options available when invoking REXXXREF code.
