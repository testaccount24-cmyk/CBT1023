---------------------------
library = &hlq.REXXXREF.JCL
---------------------------

members:
--------
  $README  (referring to this member in &hlq.REXXREF.DOC($JCLLIB))
  REXXREEF (job you should submit)
  SAMPLE   (sample job I submitted... just for comparison.

REXXXREF:
---------
  This has jcl you'll need to modify to submit to get your
  xref listings.

  Things to modify:

     1) add a job card

     2) you'll need a HLQ (high level qualifier) for the
    output datasets.

        change "// SET NEWHLQ='to your hlq'

     3) for the pds(member) that you want an xref you'll
    need to specify them in set statements:
        change/add  // SET REXXLIBR='...'   to pds library name
        change/add  //  SET REXXMEMB='...'  to pds member name

     4) submit job

     5) look at:  &NEWHLQ.REXXXREF.TLIB(&REXXMEMB) output
        look at:  &NEWHLQ.REXXXREF.XREF(&REXXMEMB) output

SAMPLE:
-------
   similar to REXXXREF job

   but this job was actually submitted multiple times with
      //  SET NEWHLQ='SFRH66.PUBLIC.SAMPLE'

      + run multiple times (with different settings for
                            REXXLIBR and REXXMEMB)

   as a result there is output in sample OUTPUT PDS datasets:
   ----------------------------------------------------------
          SFRH66.PUBLIC.SAMPLE.TREXLIB
      and SFRH66.PUBLIC.SAMPLE.XREFLIB

      so you can see what the input rexx execs are changed into
          in sfrh66.public.sample.trexlib

      so you can see what the xref listings look like:
          in sfrh66.public.sample.xreflib

      the original exec's aren't shown but, except for header,
      are identical to exec's saved in hlq.TREXLIB
