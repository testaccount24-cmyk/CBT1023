$XREF01 - documents the header portion of members in *.SAMPLE.REXXXREF.XREF

Each member in the *.XREF library has a header.

The standard header will show:
------------------------------
  1) that the scan succeeded with rc <= 4

  2) it will tell you the full data set name of the .TREX(member)
         this is a copy of the original exec with a prefix added (comments) and
         with an added "trace 's'" instruction to get a rexx scan of the exec.

  3) it will tell you the full data set name of the .XREF(member)
         this is the scan that was produced by the .TREX(member).  Scan output
         was then modified by PSTTRACE so that the standard header is created
         properly.

  4) after line "READY", it will show the name of the rexx exec / member name

  5) Then there will be "Generated scan code/comment:" lines
     a)  in comments there will be the full data set name containing
       the original rexx exec.

     b)  in comments there will be the data/time of when this exec had a xref
       generated.

  6) then the scan of the original exec follows.







The standard header looks like this:
------------------------------------

   ==> Scan of exec succeeded (rc <= 4)
   -------------------------------------------------
    1) See trace 's' exec in:
          SFRH66.PUBLIC.SAMPLE.REXXXREF.TREX(CHKAPF00)

    2) Trace listing + XREF listing in:
          SFRH66.PUBLIC.SAMPLE.REXXXREF.XREF(CHKAPF00)
   -----------------------------------------
