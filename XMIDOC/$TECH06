TECH06 - Restrictions ... what rexxxref will ignore
---------------------------------------------------


"procedure expose varlist" statement.
-------------------------------------
   1) We will dutifully reference the variable(s) listed in the "expose varlist" statement in the xref.

   2) But what we will NOT do is:  treat exposed (or non-exposed) variables any differently than any other variable.

   That said, we will try and high light these variables/stems in the xref.
   For example, you can see "Expose Ref:", below:

   Note:  if you find a variable used in a expose list (that was never set); either is was set via some command interface
   like EXECIO, some ISPF cmd, etc.  OR  it might be a mispelled variable in the expose list.

sample xref (with expose references):

Variable (set w/rexx)   xmsg                                               Assigned : 67 137 581 590
Variable (used in/rexx) xmsg                                               Reference: 590
Variable (used in/rexx) xmsg                                               Expose Ref: 628 763 1631


Stem-1 CSV_LINE.                   Expose Ref: 628 763 2472
Stem-1 CSV_LINE.0                  Assigned : 859
Stem-1 CSV_LINE.0                  Reference: 243
Stem-1 CSV_LINE.0                  Expose Ref: 628 763 2472
Stem-1 CSV_LINE.csv_lineix         Assigned : 855




XREF will not look at variable/stem use inside quoted strings.
--------------------------------------------------------------
   if you have an execio statement like:
      'EXECIO * DISKR INPUT (OPEN FINIS STEM INPUT.'

   Then the xref generated:
      Will NOT have a xref for ANYTHING on this line.
         - The line contains no rexx variables, just a literal string being passed to the command processor.

         - And there are way too many address environments with commands that might reference/set rexx variables.

   The user could re-write the execio command so INPUT. is referenced in the XREF.  But it would appear as a
   reference and not an assignment.  Rewrite could look like this (but probably more trouble than it's worth):

   Rewrite could look like this (but rewrite is more trouble than it's worth anyway):
      'EXECIO * DISKR INPUT (OPEN FINIS STEM' input.
