Hi Sam,

Here is my rexx xreference utility.

The XMI dataset restores an initial PDS used to "install" the
utility.

Once that is received, you'll find documentation, other XMI
members, and a $EXPAND job to extract the actual PDS's that
people will want to use for the xref utility.

Note:   in addition to the utility itself, I've run the utility
on some rexx execs in the sample pds(s).   Those execs were
either written by me or Roger Suhr (a co-worker) and/or some rexx
execs that came from the CBT tape itself.

When all the pds's are there, the jcl to run against a random
rexx exec is in hlq.JCL

See how you like it.

Thanks,
Rich Humphris
