This contains additional xmi members to create multiple pds's.

-  This is the CBT distribution PDS for the REXX XREF code.

-  This pds is only here to set up the other PDS's supporting
  the REXX cross reference "code".

-  Modifying/running $EXPAND is the only thing you really need
  to use in this PDS>
